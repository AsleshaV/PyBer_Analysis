# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the pyBer analysis is to determine key metrics and create various charts for data visualizations for the CEO, V. Isualize using all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and to make recommandations for the future use. we compaerd rural, suburban, and urban cities' rides from data set to calculate - total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver. Then various charts were plotted using Matplotlib for visualizing the data. 



## Results:

The results were as follows:

                            pyber_summary df

From the pyber_summary df image we can determine that Urban cities generate the more number of total rides and highest amount of total fares. Suburban is the next highest in those categories and in Rural cities are the least . Urban cities also have higher drivers count followed by the Suburban cities then followed by Rural cities.But, The average fare per ride and fare per driver are much lower in urban cities than the other 2 categories.

The multiple-line chart titled "Total Fare by City Type" showing total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January - April 2019. The urban cities fares were reported highest from around $1,600 to $2,300 during January to May 2019 period. In contrast, the rural cities fares were around $300 to $500 and suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities with around $700 to $1,300 during this time. We can also notice in the line chart that the similar peak times in total fares occurred sometime at the end of February 2019 for each city type. 

## Summary:

Based on the Data from the results,

1. we can see the majority of PyBer's revenue is from the urban cities as more usage of PyBer ridesharing in the urban cities. So, there is a scope for more employement for the drivers and generate more revneue in urban cities as they produce most rides.


2. In the Rural cities to encourage usage of rideshare, offer incentives to the driver and promos to the riders in the Rural areas can increase the total number of riders which will genrate more revenue. Further investigating into the factors for higher average fares in rual and suburban cities would be beneficial.


3. One other recommendation would be to investigate the peak times on the multiple line plot to determine what facotrs causing the spike.So that they can more effectively allocate resources to make rides more readily avilable on those high volume days.
